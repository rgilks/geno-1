Proceed in small iterative steps and test each change.
Do not block for approvals; follow `docs/SPEC.md` and keep momentum.
Prefer WebGPU via `wgpu` v24.0 and avoid WebGL2 fallbacks.
Prefer Node for servers/tooling; avoid Python for this project.
Default to pure web flow first; keep native in parity where simple.

Pre-commit and push procedure:

- Update `README.md` and `docs/TODO.md`
- Run `npm run check` to format, lint, build, and execute headless tests.
- Ensure the check is green (no warnings promoted to errors, builds succeed, tests pass).
- Commit and push only after the above succeed.
